# Calculator Front End

## Introduction
Frontend implementation for a calculator.   
Find the Back end at: https://github.com/NathanielPather/Calculator_Back_2  
Designed and implmeneted as part of the Credit Sense coding challenge.  
Implemented using Reactjs.  

## Completed Features
Component based UI.  
Interactive hover animations.  
Event handlers for button clicks.  
Logic preventing illegal operations.  
Asynchonous fetch requests.  
Use state hook for data tracking.  
Documentation generation with jsdoc.  

## Incomplete Features
Code compliancy - JSHint was resulting in incorrect errors. Unsure of coding standards available for Reactjs.  
Clear button style bug - Clear button isn't displayed like the other buttons. While I'm able to do front end development, I am too rusty and aren't enjoying solving front end issues.  

## Copied Project
Front end design and implementation was copied from: https://www.sitepoint.com/react-tutorial-build-calculator-app/  
While I'm able to do front end development, an existing solution was copied to save time during the 3 hour challenge.  
After which it seemed infeasible to start again from scratch.
